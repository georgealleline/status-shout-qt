Status Shout! v1.0
==================

The Status Shout! example application showcases the use of social medias (i.e.
Twitter & Facebook), OAuth authentication and posting status update messages
with images.

The Status Shout! application uses the ?Social Connect QML plugin, which handles
authentication of the application to different social medias and can be easily
utilised by developers in their own applications. The application also uses the
official Qt Quick Components for navigation and UI.

The Social Connect QML plugin used in the Status Shout! example application is
available at: http://projects.developer.nokia.com/socialconnect

The Status Shout! uses Qt Quick Components in numerous places. For
example, when navigating deeper into the application, the PageStack is used.
The StatusBar and ToolBar (with all the ToolButtons etc.) are used as well.

This example application demonstrates:
- Using the Social Connect QML plugin:
  - Authentication with OAuth (versions 1.0 & 2.0).
  - Posting a message to social media services.
- Using Qt Quick Components in an application that supports multiple
  resolutions and both touch UI and keypad.
- Smart startup of the application (content and application UI loaded during
  splash screen.

This example application is hosted in Nokia Developer Projects:

1. Usage
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The customised Social Connect QML plugin can be taken into use in 3rd party
either by linking it statically into the application, or by using it "as is"
by merely adding the socialconnect.sis file into the .pro file (as has been
done in the Status Shout! example application).
